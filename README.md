Created a logical diagram using Draw.io, incorporating both logical and conceptual designs within MySQL Workbench. Formulated SQL queries for a system comprising more than 15 entities, employing EERD concepts such as Specialization and Generalization, along with CRUD operations and joins. Applied principles like Normalization, Joins, and Aggregate functions extensively to craft the system's design.
